# Data Science Projects Portfolio  
Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of small but meaningful projects focused on mastering core machine learning and statistical techniques. Each project includes hands-on implementation, explanations, and visualizations using real-world datasets.  
## Project Overview  
### 1. A/B Testing  
- **Goal:** Evaluate whether a proposed change increases user engagement.
- **Techniques:** Group Comparisons, Proportion Z-Test.
- **Key Skills:** Statistical testing, conversion rate analysis, data visualization.
- **Tools:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, hypothesis testing.  
>Result: A statistically significant difference in click-through rate was found between control and treatment groups, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed change.  
### 2. Linear Regression (Using scikit-learn)  
- **Goal:** Predict a continuous target variable using one or more features.
- **Techniques:** Model training, evaluation, interpretation of coefficients.
- **Key Skills:** Data preprocessing, model evaluation metrics (MSE, RÂ²).
- **Tools:** `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`.  
>A practical application of linear regression using scikit-learn's built-in tools.  
### 3. Logistic Regression (From Scratch & scikit-learn)  
- **Goal:** Classify binary outcomes such as 0/1 or Yes/No.
- **Techniques:** Gradient Descent, Sigmoid Function, Cost Function.
- **Key Skills:** Math behind logistic regression, Python implementation from scratch, comparison with sklearn.
- **Tools:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`.  
>Built logistic regression from the ground up to deeply understand how weights and bias are learned using gradient descent.  
### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (From Scratch & scikit-learn)  
- **Goal:** Classify data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
- **Techniques:** Euclidean distance, voting mechanism, cross-validation.
- **Key Skills:** Distance-based learning, algorithm implementation from scratch.
- **Tools:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`.  
>Compared scratch implementation against `sklearn` to validate correctness and performance.
